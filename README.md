### Fibonacci Sequence

In mathematics, the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) is a sequence in which each number is the
sum of the two preceding ones.

This is a code exercise and I solve it in two ways.
1. The first method is a while loop.  This prints all the digits up to the input number.
2. The second method is using recursion.  This prints the n'th number.
